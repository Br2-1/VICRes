VIC-Res: Representation and operation of reservoirs in the Variable Infiltration Capacity model

Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) is a macro-scale hydrological model developed and maintained by the University of Washington. VIC has been used extensively to model river basins over the world. 

REQUIREMENTS
VIC-Res 
More details about how we incoporate reservoirs into the model are presented in Dang et al. (2019).
The routing component of VIC-Res is developed in FORTRAN. It requires the G77 compiler. VIC-Res has been tested on Linux Ubuntu 16.04 (Xenial Xerus) operating systems.

HOW TO RUN
